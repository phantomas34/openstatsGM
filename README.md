On top of accounting all the updates pertinent to this app, attached below is the Docker image for the app for students to run locally. 

I excel in divesting student resources from paying for Statcrunch or its adjacent PaaS platforms. Moreover, given its prevalance in introductory statistics the app also spares students 
from learning Excel functions that may or may not cooperate with their data--it is in the students' best interest to fret over the quality of their statistical accument rather than navigating 
the workarounds of Excel. 

While being cognizant that Docker is an esoteric entity among STEM undergraduate student, having access to professional and commercial software locally (with or without interest access) will be
a great benefit. Moreover, the application has received countless revisions as per faculty feedback in the eight months it has been in development prior to the spring 2026 term; faculty will have
access to the inner-workings of Openstats so they can push changes best suited for their curriculum. While the rate at which changes can be made in Openstats is faster than its paid counterparts, it
also yields more control to professors. For professors wanting to make changes it will require proficiency in the R language (99% of it is built on R), but there is a library in R that allows Python
code to be articulated into its IDE. The codebase is refactored and reflects coding practices in industry. Fundamentally, the right group of people will have a perennial product to modify to their 
liking in perpetuity. 

However, the app does not have to be reserved for introductory statistics courses; there is value in it when pertinent to lab-based courses such as chemistry, physics, and engineering given that its 
statistical calculations are on a "point and click" basis.
